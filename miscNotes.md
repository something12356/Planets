Show NEA analysis to mum! If she understands then that's a sign you're doing everything well. Anything she doesn't understand, clarify in the analysis.

NEA:
Signposting (e.g. saying what all the techniques used are, and where they're used in code)
**MORE STRUCTURED CHECKLIST, DIFFERENT SECTIONS SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS ETC, SO THAT YOU GET EVERYTHING DONE**
^^ there is also a **SUBMISSION CHECKLIST** available on teams! 12th thingy in the NEA folder!
^^ justify *why* using import math as maths (should go in desgin checklist?)
^^ justify private attributes, e.g. for validation (also design checklist?)
^^ could use matplotlib for satellites and nothing else? Or maybe matplotlib for everything, instead of pygame?

For NEA look at the *mark scheme* and tune your analysis and design to that.
^^ use it for ideas for *headings* for your document. Use it to structure everything and make sure you cover the marking criteria.

NEA also can make lines and arrows *objects.* Set a note for like, a month from now.

Research 3D graphics for python, Panda3D maybe? Probably easier than continuing with pygame
